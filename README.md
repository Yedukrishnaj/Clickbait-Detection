# Clickbait Detection in YouTube Videos


## Overview

Social media platforms, including YouTube, often host misleading content known as Clickbait Videos. This project aims to detect such videos using evidence extracted from their metadata.

## Problem Statement

The accessibility of social media has led to the widespread dissemination of inaccurate content. YouTube, with its vast user base, is particularly susceptible to videos that inaccurately depict situations. Clickbait Videos, characterized by attention-grabbing titles and thumbnails, contribute to this issue.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a system for detecting Clickbait Videos on YouTube.
- Leverage multiple metadata features for accurate identification.
- Contribute to addressing misinformation on social media platforms.

## Approach

1. **Metadata Analysis:** Extract relevant information from video metadata.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Develop features based on clickbait indicators.
3. **Machine Learning Model:** Implement a model to predict the likelihood of a video being clickbait.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using labeled datasets.
